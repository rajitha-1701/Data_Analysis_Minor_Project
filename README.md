# Data_Analysis_Minor_Project
This is a Minor Project I have done during the initial stages of learning Data Analysis using python. The data given was various movie reviews on imdb. The analysis was supposed to answer the following questions:
1) Which movie had the most profit during 2000-2005?
2) What is the average runtime of movies in the year 2000?
